<p>Welcome to The Essentialist Dev, your number one source for developer action plans. I'm dedicated to giving you the very best advice, with a focus on your learning progression, wellbeing, career and programming projects.</p>

<p>Founded in 2020 by Rebecca Williams, The Essentialist Dev has come a long way from it's beginnings as a Raw HTML blog. When Becca first started out, her passion for overcoming her internal and external obstacles drove her to find a way to help others do the same, and gave her the impetus to turn hard work and inspiration into this successful online blog.</p>

<p>I now help developers all over the world, and am thrilled to be a part of the ever-inspiring dream maker wing of the self-taught developer industry.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy the content on this blog as much as I enjoy creating them with and for you.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.</p>

<p>Sincerly,</p>

<p>Becca, creator of The Essentialist Dev</p>
