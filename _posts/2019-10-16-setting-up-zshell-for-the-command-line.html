title: Setting up ZSH (z shell) which adds some nice features to the terminal
---

<p>My colleagues use ZSH instead of bash, which has a lot of features that make it more pleasant/convenient to work from the command line. Here is an article outlining some of the <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/362409/what-is-zsh-and-why-should-you-use-it-instead-of-bash/" target="_blank">features of ZSH.</a></p>

<p>I'm going to set it up on my terminal because I like the look of it. Might explore alternatives down the line, but for now, here are the steps I took to set it up.</p>

<p>The following instructions are written rough. I haven't explained what everything means as I usually do because a colleage helped me set this up and I quickly recorded steps as we went a long.</p>

<code>brew install zsh</code>

<p class="note">'brew cask install' is for applications like Firefox etc. 'brew install' is for terminal applications like Ruby, NodeJS (or zsh) etc.</p>

<h2>Install zplug</h2>

    # There are three possible paths in life.
    #
    # 1) A command is entered at the prompt and you press return.
    #    The following steps happen:
    #    * iterm2_preexec is invoked
    #      * PS1 is set to ITERM2_PRECMD_PS1
    #      * ITERM2_SHOULD_DECORATE_PROMPT is set to 1
    #    * The command executes (possibly reading or modifying PS1)
    #    * iterm2_precmd is invoked
    #      * ITERM2_PRECMD_PS1 is set to PS1 (as modified by command execution)
    #      * PS1 gets our escape sequences added to it
    #    * zsh displays your prompt
    #    * You start entering a command
    #
    # 2) You press ^C while entering a command at the prompt.
    #    The following steps happen:
    #    * (iterm2_preexec is NOT invoked)
    #    * iterm2_precmd is invoked
    #      * iterm2_before_cmd_executes is called since we detected that iterm2_preexec was not run
    #      * (ITERM2_PRECMD_PS1 and PS1 are not messed with, since PS1 already has our escape
    #        sequences and ITERM2_PRECMD_PS1 already has PS1's original value)
    #    * zsh displays your prompt
    #    * You start entering a command
    #
    # 3) A new shell is born.
    #    * PS1 has some initial value, either zsh's default or a value set before this script is sourced.
    #    * iterm2_precmd is invoked
    #      * ITERM2_SHOULD_DECORATE_PROMPT is initialized to 1
    #      * ITERM2_PRECMD_PS1 is set to the initial value of PS1
    #      * PS1 gets our escape sequences added to it
    #    * Your prompt is shown and you may begin entering a command.
    #
    # Invariants:
    # * ITERM2_SHOULD_DECORATE_PROMPT is 1 during and just after command execution, and "" while the prompt is
    #   shown and until you enter a command and press return.
    # * PS1 does not have our escape sequences during command execution

    #   ITERM2_PRECMD_PS1 has PS1's original value.

<code>brew install rbenv fzf fasd</code>
<code>To use fzf in Vim, add the following line to your .vimrc: set rtp+=/usr/local/opt/fzf</code>

<p>Don't need to do this because we are not using it in Vim.</p>

<h2>Choose a font</h2>

<p>Download, click to install, double click to open, click install font. Once installed, open the terminal preferences (CMD-,), select 'text', then select the font you downloaded. I ended up changing to a roboto font because yayy!</p>

<code>zplug install</code>

<p>Log out of ZSH by running CTRL-D, then run:</p>
<code>zsh</code>

<p>Open a file <code>vim/etc/shells</code> (etc is a directory naming convention in this case), and <code>/usr/local/zsh</code> to the file which lets you use zsh as a shell.</p>

<code>chsh</code>

<p>Change <code>shell: /bin/bash</code> to <code>/usr/local/bin/zsh</code>. Then when prompted to 'repeat password file?' enter 'no'</p>

<p>This is what the terminal looks like when it's all up and running:</p>
