<h2>Web Components</h2>

<p>Web components are self-contained elements that have their own HTML, CSS and
JavaScript associated them. They are useful for building reusable widgets that
can be dropped into any page without the style or behavior effecting the
surrounding page.</p>

<p>Most of the tutorials on web components are pretty complicated. After
learning about them for a while, I found that it is easy to get started with
them when you build your understanding of them up in layers. So I wrote the bare
minimum code needed to create a simple hello world component. This component is
just a hello world heading element with a font family applied through the shadow
DOM.</p>


<h2>Web Component Skeleton</h2>

<p>This is a web component skeleton that has a self contained DOM including HTML
and styles that are not included in the flow of the light DOM. You can use the
component in your main DOM by using the the tag we defined for it. In this case,
the tag is <code class="language-html">&lt;bw-skeleton-component/&gt;</code>.

    <code class="language-javascript" contenteditable spellcheck="false">
      class Component extends HTMLElement {
        constructor() {
          super();
          this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });
          this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `
            <style>
                h1 {
                  font-family: sans-serif;
                }
            </style>
            <h1>Hello World!</h1>
          `;
        }
      }

      customElements.define('bw-skeleton-component');
    </code>
  </pre>
</figure>

<p>Before we create a web component, it is a good idea to think about how you
want to use it before writing any code to build it. As this is just a simple
hello world component, I'll just walk through what the code you need to create
a skeleton component does.</p>

<code class="lang-javascript">class Component extends HTMLElement { }</code>

<p>The first thing we do is create a class with the name of our component. A
class is like a car stamp that we use to stamp lots of little cars all over our
page/s.</p>

<p>It is a JavaScript convention to start our class name with an uppercase
letter (PascalCase). We do this to make it easier to spot the difference between
a class and a variable, which are usually named with lower case letters.</p>

<p>In this case, we are creating a class as an extension of another class using
he 'extends' keyword. Extending a class just means that your class contains all
of the functionality of the class you are extending, which is in addition to any
of the functionality that you define.</p>

<p>The class that we are extending is the HTMLElement class. We need to extend
this class so that we can create our own HTMLElement that we can use like any
other HTMLElements (adding event listeners, targeting with CSS, JS etc).</p>

<p>When creating a component, you can also extend classes that belong to
existing HTML elements. For example, if you wanted to create a tip component
that styles a paragraph element in a specific way, you could extend the
HTMLParagraph element instead of the more generic HTMLElement class.</p>

<p>In most cases, you are likely going to build web components that are nothing
like existing HTML elements. A pop-up is a good example of the type of web
component you are likely to want to build.</p>

<code class="lang-javascript">constructor() { }</code>

<p>Inside of our newly created component class, we have added a method called
'constructor()'. This is one of four methods that make up a components
lifecycle, and so they are called "Lifecycle methods". A brief explanation of
each is included below.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Constructor():</strong> The constructor method is called
    automatically as soon as the constructor is created, but before the
    component element has been attached to the DOM (before the component tag in
    your HTML is rendered). This is where you set attributes that don't rely on
    the DOM being rendered and for event listeners etc. It is also where you
    create the shadow DOM.</li>
  <li><strong>ConnectedCallback():</strong> The connected callback method is
    called at the moment your web component has been attached to the DOM. In
    this method, you can interact with the elements contained within or outside
    of your web component. Such as getting data from elements or setting event
    listeners on them etc.</li>
  <li><strong>DisconnectedCallback():</strong> The disconnected callback method
    is called whenever your component element is removed from the DOM. This is a
    good place to remove any event listeners or cancel time-based events like
    intervals.</li>
  <li><strong>AttributeChangedCallback(name, oldValue, newValue)</strong>: The
    attribute changed callback method is called every time an attribute that you
    have added a watcher to changes. An attribute that is being watched is
    called an observed attribute. To observe an attribute, you have to use a
    getter method containing an array of one or more attributes you want to
    watch for changes. An example of this is shown below:</li>

  <figure>
    <figcaption>Setting the attributes we want to observe</figcaption>
    <pre>
      <code class="lang-javascript">
        static get observedAttributes() {
          return ['src', 'class', 'customAttribute'];
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
  </figure>

  <p>The reason I have used the constructor method in this skeleton component
  example is because I want my component to contain a shadow DOM with it's own
  self-contained element and styling.</p>

  <code class="lang-javascript">super();</code>

  <p>The first line of code inside any constructor method has to be a call to
  the super method. In the MDN documentation, it says that we need to call super
  to establish the correct prototype chain. This didn't make sense to me so I
  asked for help understanding it.</p>

  <p>This is how the super constructor was explained to me. When a component is
  created, it inherits from another class. The constructor method initialises a
  class so that it can be used. If no constructor is called within the web
  component (we don't have to write one), then a constructor will initialise the
  class behind the scenes. The constructor does not initialise the class that we
  are inheriting from though (parent class), so we need the super method because
  it is essentially a constructor that runs on the parent class.</p>

  <code class="lang-javascript">this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });</code>

  <p>After we have called our super method, we can then go on to do some of the
  things that we are able to do using the constructor. In this case, I am going
  to open a shadow DOM which will allow me to add my heading element and
  associated styles (and JavaScript) to the component's internal DOM.</p>

  <p>The 'this' keyword refers to the object that it belongs to. In this case,
  the object is the component itself.</p>

  <p>We attach the shadow DOM to the component by calling the built in method
  'attachShadow', which accepts an object containing a mode property that you
  can set to 'open' or 'closed'.</p>

  <p class="note">For security reasons, you are not able to open a shadow DOM on
  every element (e.g. anchor tags can not have a shadow root). A list of
  elements you can attach a shadow DOM to can be found <a
  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/attachShadow"
  target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

  <p>When you set the mode to open, you are able to access the shadow DOM from
  within the web component, and outside of the web component using the
  'shadowRoot' property that we will discuss next.</p>

  <p>When you set the mode to closed, it is more difficult, but not impossible
  to access the shadow DOM from outside of the component. There is not much
  benifit to using this because it is easy to find out how to get around
  this.</p>

  <code class="lang-javascript">this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = ``;</code>

  <p>After opening the shadow DOM, we can access it using the 'shadowRoot'
  property as shown above. We can do anything that we can do with the normal DOM
  here, like setting the innerHTML, adding event listeners, appending child
  elements, querying for elements etc.</p>

  <p>In this case, I have set the innerHTML of my web component to contain a
  template literal. Which allows you to write a multi-line string that you
  can use string interpolation with if you want to. String interpolation is
  where you insert the value of a variable or code expression in your string.
  Here I just added style tags containing CSS for styling a heading that I also
  added to the template literal.</p>

  <code
    class="lang-javascript">customElements.define('bw-skeleton-component');</code>

  <p>The final thing we need to do before we can use our web component is to
  define it using the customElements.define() method. This method allows you to
  set a tag name for your component, and then it teaches the browser what your
  tag name means so that it can understand what to do with it.</p>

  <p>The customElements.define() method accepts two arguments. The first is the
  name of your tag, and the second is the name of your component class.</p>

  <p>The tag for your component must include at least one hyphen. This is
  because all of the built in HTML tags are one word, so a hyphen makes sure
  that you don't overwrite an existing tag. It is also good practice to start
  your component tag name with your initials or the inintials of your company.
  This is so that if another person downloads and uses your component, that
  there is less chance of the name being the same as a component they are using
  that has not been written by you.</p>

  <p>You can start using your component in your HTML by using the tag name as
  you would for any other HTML element.</p>

  <code class="lang-html">&lt;bw-skeleton-component/&gt;</code>

  <p>There is a lot more to learn about web components. The purpose of this
  entry was to make it easier for you to get started without having to puzzle
  through all of the complicated tutorials like I did. Hopefully after reading
  this, you will be better equipped to understand the external documentation and
  tutorials listed below.</p>
