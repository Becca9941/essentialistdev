<p>I already had MAMP installed. So I jumped right in and downloaded Wordpress from the <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/" target="_blank">Wordpress download page.</a>. Once wordpress downloaded, I opened the zipfile, which created a Wordpress folder, and dragged that folder into my site folder (htdocs &gt; site_folder).</p>

<p>On MAMP, I clicked Open WebStart page, and selected "phpMyAdmin" from the tools dropdown. On phpMyAdmin, I set up a database called 'wordpress', which I may rename later, I just want to play with the setup for now, and that generic name is good enough.</p>

<p>Once I created my database, I entered this into the browser: http://localhost:80/wordpress (took me to the site folder and into the wordpress installation folder.</p>

<p>Then I could log in to wordpress, and now my site is locally available to play with:</p>
