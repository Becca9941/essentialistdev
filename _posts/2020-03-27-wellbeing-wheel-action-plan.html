<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h2>What Is Your Definition Of Excellent Wellbeing?</h2>

<p>The Better Health Channel's definition of Wellbeing is <q>Wellbeing is not just the absence of disease or illness. It is a complex combination of a person's physical, mental, emotional and social health factors. Wellbeing is strongly linked to happiness and life satisfaction. In short, wellbeing could be described as how you feel about yourself and your life.</q>

<p>The great thing about this definition is that it's not a one-size fits all description. People with chronic illnesses or disabilities can still live full, positive lives despite significant physical or mental restrictions. Or you may find some extremely 'fit' people who struggle with some kind of addiction or mental health disorder, who might not describe themselves as being in a state of excellent wellbeing.</p>

<p>Excellent wellbeing is a very individual experience. There are many factors that come into play, and they will change over time to match your current circumstances. So it's important to come up with your own definition of excellent wellbeing so that we can come up with a plan to meet your specific needs.</p>

<p><strong>Take a moment to do that now. Go and grab a notebook, find a quiet place and think about what excellent wellbeing means to you and write it down. Here are three prompts to get you started: 1) A time when you felt your best in the past, 2) Aspects that you feel are lacking right now or could be improved and 3) Examples of other people you know or have heard of who you think are living their best lives. Bonus points if you get someone else to do the same so you can compare your notes afterwards.</strong></p>

<p>You can use your definition of wellbeing to help you in the next step, where we rate our wellbeing across several areas of our lives. It's also interesting to keep hold of your definition and write a new one now and again, so you can see how your definition has evolved over time as you begin to master some of areas that may currently be holding you back.</p>

<h2>Monthly Wellbeing Rating Scale</h2>

<p>Rating scales are used a lot by health-care professionals to get a better idea of how you are currently doing mentally and physically. The completed form allows them to work with you to develop a treatment plan that is tailored to your current needs. Multiple scales can be compared with each other to see whether the treatment plan has moved you forward or need to be adjusted.</p>

<p>You can do the same thing at home, though if your total score for the following scale turns out to be less than 80 (below average), please seek support from a health-care professional. It's a good idea to do that anyway.</p>

<p>The first thing we are going to do is fill out our own wellbeing rating scale. Then, we will use it to come up with an action plan to help us improve our wellbeing.</p>

<p><strong>For each of the life areas listed below, select a number between 1 and 10, where 1 is the worst possible rating and 10 is the best possible rating.</strong></p>

<table class="rating-table">
  <tr class="rating-table__scale-explanation">
    <th>1</th>
    <th>5</th>
    <th>10</th>
  </tr>
  <tr class="rating-table__scale-explanation">
    <td>Terrible</td>
    <td>Average</td>
    <td>Excellent</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<ul>
  <li>Health and Fitness</li>
  <li>Social/Friends</li>
  <li>Family</li>
  <li>Romance/Love</li>
  <li>Recreation/Fun</li>
  <li>Contribution</li>
  <li>Personal Growth</li>
  <li>Spiritual</li>
  <li>Self-Image</li>
  <li>Business/Career</li>
  <li>Finance/Wealth</li>
  <li>Eating Habits</li>
  <li>Physical Fitness</li>
  <li>Energy Levels</li>
  <li>Stress Coping</li>
  <li>Emotional Health</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have given yourself a rating for each of these areas, add up your total out of 160. Again, any score below average (80) is a call to action to seek support from a health-care professional.</p>
