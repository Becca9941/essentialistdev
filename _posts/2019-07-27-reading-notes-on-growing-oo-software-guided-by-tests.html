   target="_blank">Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests</a> by
 Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce</p>

<p class="note">I'm reading this book following the techniques outlined in a
book called How to Read a book, which I wrote about <a
                                                      href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-07-27-reading-notes-on-how-to-read-a-book %}">here</a></p>

<p>In this post, I am going to learn as much as I can about this book from
it's Forword only. I have done this by capturing the terms, propositions,
arguments and problems mentioned in this very short section of the book. Then I
wrote any questions I had for each of these underneath them, so that as I read
the book, I can keep the questions in mind and be aware that I want to find a
solution for them.</p>

<h2>Foreword</h2>

<h3 class="stand-out-title">Terms</h3>

<p class="note">A term is a word or a phrase that is holds an important meaning within a
book. The word can have different meanings in the book. In this section, I will
take note of the important word mentioned in the Forward for this book, as well
as any meanings that have been provided for it.</p>

<h4>Test-Driven Development</h4>

<p>Kent Beck says that the style of Test-Driven Development here is different
from the style that he practices, but that he cannot articulate why at this
stage.</p>

<ul>
  <li>How is this style of TDD different from Kent Beck's style of TDD?
    Answering this question may mean reading Kent Beck's TDD as analytically as
  I am reading this book.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Object-Oriented Design.</h4>

<p>No definition for OO design provided in the forword.</p>

<h3 class="stand-out-title">Prepositions</h3>

<p class="note">A preposition is a statement where the author takes a stance on a subject
either for or against the truth of something. After completing this book, I will
be looking back to see what evidence could be found in support of these
prepositions.</p>

<p>Kent Beck says that from this book, we can learn how to program to sustain
productivity and how to look at our programs anew.</p>

<ul>
  <li>How exactly does this book teach us to sustain productivity?</li>
  <li>How exactly does this book teach us to look at our programs anew?</li>
</ul>

<p>Kent Beck also says that this book presents a coherent and consistent system of
development, where different techniques support each other.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is meant by coherent and consistent system of development?</li>
  <li>What different techniques are there?</li>
  <li>How exactly and in what ways do the different techniques support each
    other?</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="stand-out-title">Arguments</h3>

<p class="note">Arguments are major points or issues that are addressed throughout the book.
Arguments can be made up of a series of prepositions that form reasons in
support or against arguments that are being made. As with the prepositions, I
will be going back over these to see the extent to which the book can be said to
support these arguments.</p>

<h4>Garden perspective</h4>

<p>In the forword for this book, Kent Beck says that this book presents a new
perspective, and says that what if we treated programs like gardens to be
nurtured, pruned, harvested, fertilized and watered, instead of something that
we 'finish'.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the garden perspective 'shifting' from?</li>
</ul>


<h3 class="stand-out-title">Problems</h3>

<p class="note">Problems are obstacles that the author/s say need to be overcome and dealt
with. Here are the problems that are pointed out within the book. After reading
the book I will come back and see the extent to which these problems were or
were not solved by the book.</p>

<h4>How to realease more software in less time - indefinitely</h4>

<p>In the foreword for this book, Kent Beck says that one of the problems posed
by the move to shorter and shorter release cycles is how to release more
software in less time - and to continue releasing indefinitely.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Does this book solve the problem of releasing more software in less
    time?</li>
  <li>If so, exactly what solution/s are suggested?</li>
</ul>

<p>From reading the forword of Growing Object-Oriented Software Guided by tests
alone, we can infer that the book offers a new perspective by which software is
likened to a garden that we grow and maintain over time. We also know that this
book contains techniques for achieving this in a way that will apparently help
us to release more software, more quickly. According To Kent Beck, the authors
employ a different version of Test-Driven Development than he does, but exactly
why it is different remains unclear.</p>
