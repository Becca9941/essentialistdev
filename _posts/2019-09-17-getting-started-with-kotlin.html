title: Hello World Kotlin project in IntelliJ IDEA
---

<h2>Creating a new project</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Create a new project from File | New. Select the Kotlin | JVM | IDEA project type and click 'Next'.</li>
  <li>Give your project a name 'Hello World' and select an SDK version for it. My version was 1.8 by default, left it at that. Click 'Finish'.</li>
  <li>Now there is a new project with a 'HelloWorld' folder, External Libraries and Scratches and Consoles.</li>
  <li>In the HelloWorld folder, create a new file inside the 'src' folder and call it anything (I called mine 'app'). I created a new file by right-clicking on the Src folder, clicking on "New", then clicked on "Kotlin File/Class".</li>
  <li>Inside the app file, add the 'main' function, which is the entry point to a Kotlin application. You can do this quickly in IntelliJ IDEA by typing 'main' and hitting the tab key.</li>
  <li>Run the code by clicking the green triangle in the gutter. After doing this, it should compile and open a terminal window with the results. Yayyyy!</li>
</ul>

<pre>
<code>
fun main() {
    println("Hello World!")
}
</code>
