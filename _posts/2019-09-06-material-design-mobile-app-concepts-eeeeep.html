title: Mobile app version of this website - using material design techniques
---

<p>Oh my golly gosh I am so excited!</p>

<p>I have spent 13 hours straight designing mobile app screens (8 hrs for work, 5hrs for side project). While it's been a really fun day, really don't recommend working like that, ever. Totally exhausted right now, and will probably need the weekend to recover.</p>

<p>I'll share each of the four screen designs that I designed today, along with a few notes about what I plan to do with them.</p>

<p>It's incredible surreal knowing that it's possible to design something and then to actually be able to build it from the ground up, with a lot of nice animation effects, and fully mobile responsive. It's going to take a LOT of time to actually finish this project, but there's no rush.</p>

<p>Too tired to explain this properly right now so will just provide the screenshots of the four screens</p>

<h2>Menu</h2>

<p class="note">I'll be swapping out the hamburger icon for the word 'menu' because it's more explicit.</p>
