<p>I have been trying out a few HIIT workout timer apps lately but haven't really liked any of them. Either the interface is on point but the features are lacking or vice versa. I want to make something that is a joy to use. Something really thoughtful.</p>

<p>To start with, I'm going to browse HIIT timers on the Google Play store and capture all of the likes/dislikes mentioned in the feedback comments.</p>


<h3>Likes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Paid for the premium version to be able to save more workouts.</li>
  <li>Customizable voice notifications!</li>
  <li>Really easy to build your own workout.</li>
  <li>Clear, easy to use and does exactly what is promised.</li>
  <li>Very easy to organise and has a clean design.</li>
  <li>It would be nice to have an option to put a description/note for each exercise so that we'll remember how to do it.</li>
  <li>Great customer service.</li>
  <li>It would be awesome if it could run in a small window over other apps like YouTube or at least if it could continue to run in the background.</li>
  <li>I'd like to be able to make adjustments in the times after they have been set.</li>
  <li>What would be nice is an option for us to put small thumbnail size images next to each exercise.</li>
  <li>I'd love it if the last tone on the final interval was extra long so I'd know without looking that I'm finished.</li>
  <li>Will be very nice if there is a preview of the next exercise so I can get well prepared during rest time.</li>
  <li>Completely customizable. i was able to set up my own workout with varying exercises, times and rests.</li>
  <li>Downloaded for its voice notification for each set.</li>
  <li>Personally I liked the boxing bell sound because it makes me feel like I finished a round and won!</li>
  <li>Updates are always useful and add a good feature like being able to save your timers.</li>

<h3>Improvement needs</h3>

<ul>
  <li>It won't let me open my keyboard to write in a name for a set/exercise. It pops up then closes right away.</li>
  <li>Will not let you save two workouts until you pay for premium. Should at least let you save two.</li>
  <li>Annoying ads on close/open.</li>
  <li>It quits the workout if you close out the app.</li>
  <li>I couldn't get it to work in the background consistently while I was doing emails and other computer tasks (pomodoro).</li>
  <li>Big problem is it tends to crash or stop timers when you lock the screen. Really annoying problem, especially if you go for a run and just want to listen to the notifications of when to slow down or speed up.</li>
  <li>The arrange feature works erratically so one is left trying to order the exercises.</li>
  <li>Would have rated it higher if it stopped spamming about its Facebook group all the time, despite paying for the premium version.</li>
  <li>Wish it counted down rather than up and had sound.</li>
  <li>Just wish if there was an additional voice prompt which would indicate whether its a work period, rest period, prep time or cooling period.</li>
  <li>I'd like the pause/play buttons to be larger. They're relatively small in the bottom corner and could be enlarged.</li>
  <li>Has no integration with Google Fit or any other fitness tracker.</li>
  <li>App works but the new app icon with yellow border is too hideous to keep installed on my phone. I hate looking at it.</li>
  <li>Wish you could lable each of th erounds and have the option to set each round a different time.</li>
  <li>Wish I could change the countdown time.</li>
  <li>I can't define how many intervals I want to repeat.</li>
  <li>I would appreciate if you add the pause option.</li>
  <li>It should be configurable with how many seconds left it would start counting outloud.</li>
  <li>The UI could be improved, especially for tablet use.</li>
  <li>Looking for an app that allows varing set lengths.</li>
  <li>When headphones are connected via blue tooth, it will not play the loud beeps through the headphones but instead through the phone which makes it unusable at the gym.</li>
  <li>I want to be able to change the background colors.</li>
  <li>Could have an option to extend the intro countdown. 5 secs is too short.</li>
  <li>To add a vibration would be another nice option.</li>
  <li>Can you add a countdown timer option that gradually gets louder?</li>
  <li>Awkward portrait mode display (portrait and landscape)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Users</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Runners who want to listen when to speed up or slow down.</li>
  <li>HIIT exercisers who want to customise their own workouts.</li>
  <li>Self-starters who want to use the interval timer as a pomodoro clock (running in the background while they do other tasks).</li>
  <li>People who are recommended exercises from the hostpital, to make it easier to keep track of number of sets and reps.</li>
  <li>Gym goers who want to work out using headphones so as to not disturb other people.</li>
  <li>Tablet users who would appreciate a responsive interface.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Thoughts on Feedback points</h2>

<p>There is a lot of excellent feedback points here. Most of these things are hard to anticipate. I would never have come up with half of these by myself. Interestingly, many of these feedback points were repeated across the top 5 apps on the play store, so it seems like the app developers didn't go through the feedback before hand like this.</p>

<p>It is also easy to get overloaded with all of the 'nice to haves' in the list above. So when I build this, I'll start off trying to make it as simple as possible. I'll really need to practice encapsulation and extendability, because I know there's always going to be good feedback and change/improvement suggestions that I'll need to be prepared for.</p>

<p>This was fun!</p>

<h2>Simplest version</h2>

<p>Next is to come up with the requirements for the simplest version of this app that I can come up with that has an exceptional user interface and generally just feels amazing to use, even if it doesn't have all the 'nice-to-have' features yet.</p>

<p>For my own personal use, I want to be able to create a workout that has any number of sets that each consist of a workout time and a rest time. The sets can be duplicated, or created with varying times. Each set should have a name. The workout should also have a name. The workout should also have a customisable warmup (or intro time) before the timers start. A countdown on the screen for each of the timers. A beeper which counts down from 5 seconds and below. A voice which says '[time] warmup', '[time] workout' and '[time] rest'</p>

<p>When I make this, I'll have to break it down into tiny simple steps, because there is a lot going on there in my ideal mvp that actually does the bare minimum I'd appreciate.</p>

<p>Some ideas for things that would be nice to have: Being able to see what's coming next.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Number of times each workout has been completed (as well as dates)</li>
  <li>A calendar where you can assign workouts to it.</li>
  <li>Change the color of the rest/interval/warmup</li>
  <li>Attach a note to each exercise.</li>
</ul>
