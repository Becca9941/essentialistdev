<p class="note">The notes in this article are heavily based on <a
   href="https://c2.com/doc/oopsla89/paper.html" target="_blank">A Laboratory for Teaching
   Object-oriented Thinking</a> by Kent Beck and Ward Cunningham.</p>

<h2>Difficulties learning Object-Oriented Thinking</h2>

<ul>
  <li>It's difficult to teach beginner programmers and experienced procedural
    programmers how to think with an anthropomorphic persective, which is needed
    to understand Object-Oriented design. Anthropomorphic means treating animals
    and objects as if they are human in appearance.</li>
  <li>According to the authors, the most difficult thing about teaching
    Object-oriented programming is getting the learners to let go of their
    reliance on global knowledge that is common to a procedural programming way
    of doing things.</li>
  <li>Kent Beck and Ward Cunningham have found that the most effective way of
    thinking in Objects is to immerse the learner in the "objectness" of the
    material, which involves removing as much familiar material as possible.
    They say that the syntax and programming environment operation will be
    picked up quickly enough once the fundementals have been thoroughly
    understood.</li>
  <li>The authors use CRC cards to introduce Object-Oriented design. CRC stands
    for Class, responsibility and Collaboration.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">I am struggling to understand Object-oriented thinking for the
same reasons that have been outlined above. The CTO of the startup I work at
said it took him years to 'get' Object-oriented, but one day it all clicked into
place and the click was probable audible to the people around him. Two other
extremely experienced and talented developers confirmed the same thing happened
for them. They said that working with someone who really gets it played a big
part in helping them get to the click moment.</p>

<p class="note">They also said not to feel like a
bad programmer if I'm struggling to get it. That everything I'm learning and
practicing is like a cube of sugar on a weighing scale. The first one you add
does nothing to adjust the weight, the first dozen also do nothing. But at some
point, the scales will suddenly tip and it'll all finally make sense.</p>

<h2>CRC Cards (Class, responsibility and Collaboration</h2>

<ul>
  <li>It is important to choose a class name that really helps you to discuss
    the design from an abstract/metaphorical perspective. Take your time finding
    just the right set of words to describe your objects. Words that are close
    to the business language so that non-programmers know exactly what you are
    talking about even if really you are talking about code</li>
  <li>Responsibilities identify problems that need to be solved. They serve as a
    handle for discussing potential solutions. Responsibilities are written as
    short phrases containing verbs (with at least one active verb). The better
    that these phrases express potential solutions, the more powerful and
    concise the design will be.</li>
  <li>Kent Beck and Ward Cunningham say that one of the distinguishing features
    of object-oriented design is that no object is an island. They all stand in
    relationship to one another. They rely on each other for services and
    control. They are each a collaborator who can send messages to each other
    with the aim of satisfying responsibilities. The messages they send are tell
    only, they don't tell another object what to do.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">One of the really interesting things that happened at work was
when the CTO was explaining his view of the system as a series of gates that
were either open, closed or locked. The gates could only be locked by someone
with authority who was in possession of a master key. The CEO (who is an
executive chef) heard this metaphor and started using it to explain the system
to his business partners. So while we were in fact discussing code, it was
accessible to a non-programmer who was able to join in on the discussion and
ask questions or offer course corrections to be discussed if needed.</p>

<h2>Using CRC cards in practice</h2>

<ul>
  <li>CRC cards represent multiple objects at the same time. They don't just
    outline messages that different objects might send to each other. They also
    show the collaboration between objects. The messages are not written as
    method names, but as english readable phrases that describe potential
    solutions to problems.</li>
  <li>The cards are used to help developers not only design their system, but to
    tell the story of their system in plain english, with no reference to
    programming syntax.</li>
  <li>The cards themselves are written with a class name at the top. Then the
    card is split into two sections. The left side contains responsibilities.
    The right side contains other objects that the current object collaborates
    with.</li>
  <li>Before writing the cards, developers are presented with a simple scenario
    and perhaps one or two objects. If a situation calls for a responsibility
    that has not already been covered by one of the existing objects, then we
    either add the responsibility to one of those objects or create a new object
    to address that responsibility.</li>
  <li>If one of the objects becomes too cluttered, then we copy the information
    on its card, to a new card whilst searching for a more powerful and more
    concise way of expressing what the object does. If it's not possible to
    simplify the object further, then we consider creating a new object to
    assume some of the responsibilites.</li>
  </li>Finally, the authors stress the importance of creating objects not to
  meet the mystical future needs that we can imagine, but only to meet the
  demands of the current moment. If we design objects properly, it will be
  easier to extend the system to accomodate new responsibilites at a later date.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
