title: Getting started with kotlin koans offline
---

<p>There is a <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/koans.html" target="_blank">Kotlin koans</a> course that is designed to get us familiar with Kotlin. Instead of doing the online version, I wanted to get them set up in my IntelliJ developer environment. This is so that I can look through the tests and see how they have been set up.</p>

<p>The first step is installing a plugin that includes the Kotlin Koans course.</p>

<h2>Installing EduTools plugin</h2>

<ul>
  <li>In the 'Settings/Preferences' diolog, select 'Plugins'.</li>
  <li>In the plugins dialog, switch to the 'MarketPlace' tab.</li>
  <li>Search for 'EduTools' and click 'Install'.</li>
  <li>Click 'OK' and restart IntelliJ IDEA if prompted.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Opening the Koans Course</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Select file | Learn and Teach | Browse Courses, from the toolbar at the top.</li>
  <li>Select 'Kotlin Koans' and click the 'Join' button.</li>
  <li>Work through course.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tasks in course</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Simple functions: make the function 'start' return the string "OK".</li>
  <li>Java to Kotlin conversion - Copy and paste Java code into the Kotlin file and agree to automatically convert it to Kotlin when prompted.</li>
  <li>Named Arguments: specifying only two arguments, make the function 'joinOptions() return the list in a JSON format (e.g. "[a, b, c]").</li>
</ol>

<p>This introductory course is definitely not an introductory course, it assumes way too much prior knowledge of Java, which Kotlin is based on. It doesn't work for total beginners.</p>
