leading: Armed with a bullet journal and a self-development book containing small and easy steps to wellness, I am undertaking a 52 week journey to save my mental health.
---

<p>On the 27th of February 2020, I was released from a voluntary stay at a psychiatric ward. I couldn't cope with PTSD, and gave up. I didn't want to live anymore. Or at least, I didn't want to live with my mind and emotions feeling like they were woven with threads of torture anymore.</p>

<p>The psychiatric ward helped me in 6 main ways: Sleep, food, meds, therapy, human connection, digital disconnect.</p>

<p>All of those things in combination eased my symptoms just enough that I could start thinking about how to help myself get better, despite having very little energy or willpower.</p>

<p><strong>I had to truly understand and accept that my healing journey was not going to be fast.</strong> That I'd have to work below my usual capacity, so that I could put more energy into the healing process, for an unknown length of time.</p>

<p>One of the first things I did upon getting out of the psych ward, was to pick up a bullet journal (a notebook with dot-grid numbered pages) to be used as a Wellness and Recovery Journal.</p>

<p>I'm using this Wellness and Recovery journal to track monthly mental health metrics, as well as tracking how I go with trying out new wellness habits.</p>

<p>I also picked up a self-development book that caught my eye. It is called <a href="https://www.rockpoolpublishing.com.au/your-best-year-ahead" target="_blank">Your Best Year Ahead: Small, easy steps to wellness</a> by Dr. Chris Beer. I chose this book because small, easy steps is exactly what I needed during a time where I was struggling to even brush my teeth.</p>

<p>I liked how the book introduced a new habit a week, where each habit built upon the previous habit.</p>

<p>Once the week is up, you carry your newly tried habit into the next week. By the end of the 52 weeks you will be practicing 52 new habits all at the same time, with most of them having become automatic by that point.</p>

<h2>Weekly Wellness Habits</h2>

<p>Every week, I'll publish my own modified versions of the habits, in most cases diving deeper into the science behind them and tailoring them/extending them to match my specific lifestyle.</p>

<p>I won't be sharing the exact habit challenges for each week because that wouldn't be fair on the author, but my modified versions. If you decide to get the book too (it's great!), then I encourage you to do the same. <strong>It's easier to stick to habits that you have ownership of.</strong></p>

<p>Each wellness habit will come with its own downloadable action plan if you decide my habit practices could work for you too.</p>
