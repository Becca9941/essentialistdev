<p class="note">I was going to save this as a draft because it is nowhere near
publishable ready. I've literally just captured a few really interesting
insights from conversations at work. I want to think about all of the concepts
listed below in more detail and tell each section as a better story. But I'm
leaving it raw, not going to hide anything until it's 'perfect' anymore.</p>

<h2>Imperative stories/programming</h2>

<p>In an imperative story, you only see what happens from the point of view of
the main character. The other character 'sees' all of the other characters, but
you don't get to see the story from the other character's points of view. The
story is inflexible</p>

<h2>Non imperative stories</h2>

<p>In a non-imperative story, the story is told from the points of view of many different
characters who each have their own individual stories. The main story is woven
from the interactions between the characters, and depends on the mood of the
characters at the time, and the environment that they are in. If the environment
changes or the internal state of the characters is different, then you get an
entirely different story.</p>

<h2>Criminology, piecing perspectives</h2>

<p>As a criminology student, this is how I wrote essays. I would start with the
main case, the problem statement that was usually told from the point of view of
one character. I would use that view as a baseline and then look for other
perspectives without being judgemental. I'd take their stories and compare them
to each other. In most cases, the different perspectives would reveal a
different part of the story.</p>

<h2>Tv shows</h2>

<p>Boomtown is a TV series similar to CSI (Crime Scene Investigation) show. One
event is told, but it is told from four or more different perspectives.</p>

<h2>Work worries</h2>

<p>I find it hard to remember the storylines of TV shows or books that I have
read. This is something that can make work difficult. When I work on my own
projects I know the full story so it's easy for me to know how to make changes.
At the moment I code in a more imperative style. At work, things are a mix of
imperative and non-imperative. There is a lot of not so great legacy code that
is being re-written. I find it hard to make changes because of the codebase
being non-imperative. It's pretty big, so I don't know the existence of some
characters. I'm not sure what the possible interactions could be or which
character to ask for the specific information I need.</p>
