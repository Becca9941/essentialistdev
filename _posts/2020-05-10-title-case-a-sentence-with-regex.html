<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

<p>Return the provided string with the first letter of each word capitalized. Make sure the rest of the word is in lower case.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this exercise, you should also capitalize connecting words like "the" and "of".</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>In my original solution (shown below), I first split my str into lowercase words. Then I mapped my word array into a new array where the first letter of each word was capitalized, before joining the new title-cased words into a new setence:</p>

<pre>
<code>
function titleCase(str) {
  const lowerCaseWords = str.toLowerCase().split(" ");

  lowerCaseWords.map(word =&gt; word.replace(word[0], word[0].toUpperCase()));

  return lowerCaseWords.join(" ");
}

titleCase("I'm a little tea pot");
</code>
</pre>

<p>After doing this, I thought it'd be cool to try and solve the same problem, but this time using a regex approach. Here is what I came up with:</p>

<pre>
<code>
function titleCase(str) {
  const lowerCase = str.toLowerCase();

  return lowerCase.replace(/\w\S*/g, x => x.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + x.substr(1).toLowerCase());
}

titleCase("I'm a little teapot");
</code>
</pre>

<p>I prefer my first approach because it's easier to read, but this was fun to figure out.</p>
