<p>Notes are heavily bases on <a href="https://books.pharo.org/learning-oop/" target="_blank">Learning Object-Oriented Programming, Design and TDD with Pharo</a></p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Before reading a programming book, I like to read the table of contents, introduction and preface to pull out the key concepts that will be covered in the book. That way, I can read in a more focused manner and revisit the list of concepts I captured to check that I understand them.</p>

<p>My plan is to use this entry as a keystone entry that links to other articles I have written about each of the concepts outlined below, supplemented with other research from sources outside of the book for cross-reference.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Objects / Classes</li>
  <li>Messages / Methods</li>
