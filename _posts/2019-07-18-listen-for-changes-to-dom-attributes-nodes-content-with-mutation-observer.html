  <p>I am learning about the Mutation Observer for work so that we can re-draw
  (render) information on the page when elements are added and removed
  dynamically.</p>


  <p>The MutationObserver is a JavaScript feature that is similar to an event
  listener. It allows you to listen for changes in the DOM like when an
  attribute is changed, when an element is added or removed or when content is
  changed.</p>

  <p>There are five main change scenarios that the Mutation Observer can be used
  to listen for. These are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Attributes</strong>: When an elements src, class, id, type etc
      attribute is changed. Also listens for changes in custom defined
      attributes like a counter or attributes used withing custom tags created
      as a web component.</li>

    <li><strong>CharacterData</strong>: When content such as innerHTML,
      textContent within an element is changed.</li>

    <li><strong>ChildList</strong>: When an element is added or removed from a
      parent element like the DOM as a whole, or things like a div container or
    lists etc.</li>

    <li><strong>Subtree</strong>: Allows you to listen for changes to an element
      and all of its descendents.</li>

    <li><strong>AttributeOldValue</strong>: Lets you specify whether you want
      the previous value of changed attributes to be stored for you to use.</li>

    <li><strong>CharacterDataOldValue</strong>: Lets you specify whether you
      want the previous value of changed text nodes to be stored for you to
      use.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Most of the tutorials on Mutation Observers are pretty complicated. They
  show you how to listen for multiple change events at once, each with
  a chain of behaviours associated with them.</p>

  <p>So I've just written up a simple example that allows you to watch for
  change events. Whenever a change occurs, two behaviours occur. The first is a
  simple alert message, the second is a console log of all of the change events
  that have happened so far, which the mutation observer tracks for you.</p>

  <h2>Create an instance of the MutationObserver</h2>

  <figure>
    <figcaption>New mutation observer instance</figcaption>
    <pre>
      <code class="language-javascript">
        const mutationObserver = new MutationObserver(function(mutations) {
          alert("boo");
          mutations.forEach(function(mutation) {
            console.log(mutation);
          });
        });
      </code>
    </pre>
  </figure>

  <p>The first thing we do above is create a new instance of the
  MutationObserver class and assign it to a variable called
  mutationObserver.</p>

  <p>The mutation observer accepts a callback function as a paramater. This
  callback function also accepts an argument that I have called 'mutations'
  (common name used), which stores all of the changes that we are looking for in
  an array. Every time a new change occurs, the change is added to this mutations array argument.</p>

  <p>The callback function contains the code that we want to execute whenever a
  new change that we are watching for occurs. In this case, there are two
  behaviours. The first behaviour is a simple message that pops up as an alert.  You can substitute the alert for your own behaviour. </p>

  <p>The second behaviour displays all of the change events that have occurred
  so far in the console. I used a forEach loop to do this. The mutation object
  stores information about the change event itself, and also information about
  the element that triggered the event.</p>

  <h2>Watch for the changes you are interested in</h2>

  <p>Now that we have our Mutation Observer object we can start listening for
  changes using the built-in observe method. The observe method takes two
  arguments. The first is the element you want to watch for changes. This can be
  the body of the document, a div container, a list etc. The second argument is
  a settings object. The settings object contains the change events you want to
  listen for. You can listen to one, a few or all of them at a time. Here is
  what the code for this looks like:</p>

  <figure>
    <figcaption>Setting what changes to observe</figcaption>
    <pre>
      <code class="language-javascript">
        const taskList = document.querySelector('.task-list');

        mutationObserver.observe(taskList, function({
          attributes: true,
          characterData: true,
          childList: true,
          subtree: true,
          attributeOldValue: true,
          characterDataOldValue: true
        });
      </code>
    </pre>
  </figure>

  <p>If you don't want to watch for all of these changes, just include the
  change events you do want to observe. Changing the value to false will not
  stop them from being observed. For example, setting 'subtree' to false is
  telling the observer to only watch the target element for changes instead of
  all of its descendents.</p>

  <h2>Stop watching changes</h2>

  <p>To stop your MutationObserver from watching for change events and
  triggering behaviour when they occur, you can use the disconnect method which
  accepts no arguments, like this:
  <code class="language-javascript">mutationObserver.disconnect();</code></p>
