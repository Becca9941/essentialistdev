title: Writing and running TDD style tests in Pharo (Smalltalk)

<p>Notes are based on Pharo by Example, a free book suggested by a Mooc called <a href="https://www.canal-u.tv/producteurs/inria/cours_en_ligne/live_object_programming_in_pharo">Live Object Programming in Pharo</a></p>

<h3>What is TDD?</h3>

<p>TDD stands for Test-Driven Development. It is where you write a test that
defines the behaviour you want your code to perform, BEFORE we write the code
that implements that behaviour.</p>

<p>In the Pharo by example book, they want a method that turns a string into
it's uppercase version so that it looks like shouting.</p>

<h3>Defining a new test method in Pharo</h3>

<p>Before we define a test method in Pharo, we have to decide which class the
method should belong to. In the shouting string case, the class that our method
belongs to is a string. So we will call our test "StringTest". It is
conventional to name test files with the class name of the method we are testing
(starting with an uppercase letter) followed by the word "Test" (also Pascal
case with no spaces between the words).</p>

<p>To define a test, we first open the System browser on the the class
StringTest. We can do this by typing "StringTest" in our editor (or Playground)
, selecting it, and then running Command-B, which opens up the system browser on
this class.</p>

<p>In the next panel to the right of our test, we need to select the right
protocol for our method. A protocol includes data about how a class is expected
to be used, including the order in which methods expect to be invoked. <a
                                                                         href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3AProtocol_(object-oriented_programming)"
                                                                         target="_blank">More
                                                                         information
                                                                         here</a>.</p>

<p>In this case, we select the "tests-converting" protocol (not to be confused
with the "testing - converting protocol"). At the moment, I can't find much
information on what this protocol means, so will bookmark it to look into.</p>

<p>After you have selected your protocol, you can replace the template code in
the bottom panel of the system browser with your test method. The test method
that we have written for our shout method is as follows:</p>

<figure>
  <figcaption>Test for shout method</figcaption>
  <pre>
  <code class="lang-smalltalk">
  testShout
    self assert: ('No panic' shout = 'NO PANIC!')
  </code>
  </pre>
</figure>

<p>After typing this test into the system browser, the corner of the panel
containing the test method turns orange and looks like a blurred fold like a
book that has been dog-eared. This is a reminder that the pane contains unsaved
changes. You can save by running Command-S This is a reminder that the pane
contains unsaved changes. You can save by running Command-S. If this is the
first time you have saved code to your Image, you will be prompted to enter your
name. Enter your name without any spaces.</p>

<p>As we have not written any code yet to pass the test, a message should pop up
at the bottom of the panel telling you that the message (method) shout has been
sent but not implemented.<p>

<p class="note">When I wrote the test decribed in the book, the quality
assurance messenger at the bottom of the system browser told me to use assert:
equals: instead of assert: and =. It asked if I wanted it to correct my test for
me and I chose yes. This is what the test method now looks like:</p>

<figure>
  <figcaption>Improved Test for shout method</figcaption>
  <pre>
  <code class="lang-smalltalk">
  testShout
    self assert: 'No panic' shout equals: 'NO PANIC!'
  </code>
  </pre>
</figure>

<h2>Running the test method</h2>

<p>To run your newly created test, click on the little circle icon next to the
method name in the top panel of the system browser. Hovering over this will show
a tooltip that says "Run the tests". <span class="note">The circle icon looks
  like a grey oversized bullet point. My eyes skipped over this a few times so
  pointing it out here for future reference). Also, you want to be clicking on
  the circle next to "testShout", not "StringTest".</span> You can also run the tests by opening the "Test Runner" from the World Menu, though this is a little slower.</p>

<p>After running the test a small pop up panel also appears with a toolbar at
the top with the options "Proceed", "Abandon", "Debug" and "Report". If you
click on the "Debug" option another window will pop up. It will provide an error
message. In this case, the error message is "shout self
shouldBeImplemented."</p>

<h2>Implementing the test method</h2>

<p>Without leaving the debugger, we can implement our test method by clicking on
the "Create" button in the debugger. (for some reason this option wasn't in my
debugger, instead the Shout class I needed had already been created and was
listed as an option. I'll have to write another test case to figure out what's
happening here next time.</p>

<p>When I clicked on the test case there was a method template stub, just like
there was for the test method. I replaced the stub code with the method that
would make the test pass, which is as follows:</p>

<figure>
  <figcaption>Implementing shout test method</figcaption>
  <pre>
  <code class="lang-smalltalk">
    shout
      ^ self asUppercase, '!'
  </code>
  </pre>
</figure>

<p>I compiled this method by saving the code with Command-S. Then I clicked the
'Proceed' button in the debugger to implement it. Finally, I ran the test again
by clicking on the red icon next to the same "testShout" method as before. The
icon turned green and a little 'toast' notification popped up to tell me that my
test had run successfully.</p>
