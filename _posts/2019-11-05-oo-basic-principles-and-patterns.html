title: Object-oriented Basics, Principles and Patterns
---

<p>In writing...</p>

<p>A place to bookmark Object-oriented basics, principles and patterns. Kind of like an index.</p>

<h2>Object-oriented Basics</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Abstraction</li>
  <li>Encapsulation</li>
  <li>Polymorphism</li>
  <li>Inheritance</li>
</ul>

<h2>Object-oriented Principles</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Encapsulate what varies</li>
  <li>Favour composition over inheritance</li>
  <li>Program to interfaces, not to implementations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Object-oriented Patterns</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Strategy - defines a family of algorithms (duck quacks, different Zelda items), encapsulates each one (into individual classes), and makes them interchangeable (compose them with another class - add the interface as an instance variable that can be swapped out).</li>
</ul>
