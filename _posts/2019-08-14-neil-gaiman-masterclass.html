<h2>Truth in fiction</h2>

<h3>Workbook</h3>

<blockquote>
  "We're using memorable lies. We are taking people who do not exist and things that did not happen to those people, in placesthat aren't, and we are using those things to communicate true things."
</blockquote>

<p>Using a 'lie' of a made-up story to reach a human truth is one of the central tools of literature. It doesn't matter how outlandish the world of your story is, it should feel real to the reader, known as <em>verisimilitude</em></p>

<h3>Tools</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>Provide specific, concrete sensory details</h4>
    <p>You can make up an underground tunnel that doesn't exist, but if you describe the smell of sewage and the persistent dripping of water, you draw your reader into a concrete experience that contributes to the sense of reality.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Focus on emotions that are true to your characters</h4>
    <p>You hero might be fighting an impossible beast, but everyone will be able to relate to their fear.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Incorporate the familiar alongside the unfamiliar</h4>
    <p>Keeping the reader grounded in things they recognize is just as important as introducing new and interesting elements.</p></li>
  <li>
    <h4>Avoid technical mistakes</h4>
    <p>If you're writing about the real world, get the facts straight. If you're writing a magical world, stay consistent with the laws of your creation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Take time to cover objections</h4>
    <p>If something isn't right in your world, let your characters notice that is isn't right for them either.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To understand verisimilitude, study books about counterfactual genre. These books tackle "what if" questions, such as "What if Hitler had won the war?". They set theri stories in a familiar reality that is twisted in some meaninful way.</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Choose a page or scene from any of the counterfactual books listed (I'm thinking Fatherland (1992) by Robert Harris and answer the following questions: 1) Are your descriptive details specific? Can you make them sensory? 2) Is your character's behavior in line with their personality? Do their responses make sense for them? 3) Can you fact-check anything? If so, do it now.</li>
  <li>Pick one of the essays from the list in the PDF and as yourself whether you agree with the author's opinions. If not, write a response or an essay of your own. Try to "show too much of yourself".</li>
  <li>To practice honesty in your writing, choose one of the moments listed and write a few paragraphs about it. Pay attention to your inner register about what you are writing, noting the particular things that make you uneasy. Try to be "a little more honest than you are comfortable with". Afterwards, read the work aloud to someone you trust. Listen to the way you sound and pay attention to the sensations in your body as you're reading the difficult moment. Consider what you're afriad of being judged for, or afraid of saying out loud. Write those things down.
    <ul>
      <li>A time when you were deeply embarrassed (Dave)</li>
      <li>When you regret something you did</li>
      <li>The saddest moment of your life</li>
      <li>A secret you are afraid to talk about</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>My Ideas</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Write a few short, realistic stories about Berry, observing his behavior</li>
  <li>Write a story about Stix, the environment as it is. Bring the pain points to life, show the real ways that the Q-Pack solves those problems in real ways that the user can really connect to.</li>
  <li>Describe a fantasy animal with realistic 'catlike' characteristics. Go to a zoo, or watch animal videos, fish documentaries and do the same. Think about animals that elicit fear and describe why</li>
  <li>Write short what if stories where you made different decisions in your life, or just alternate realities.</li>
  <li>Write an essay about what minimalism means to me, using storytelling. Maybe a scene of joy from playing on the beach at night.</li>
  <li>Show too much of myself by explaining how I feel at work when I am frustrated and feel like I'm not good enough at what I do</li>
</ul>


<h2>Sources of Inspiration</h2>

<p>All writers have a compost heap that rots down that creates fertilizer that helps you grow a beautiful garden. Most people can point to the things that are similar to them in their own field, but it's a different thing entirely to point to the things that influence you from different fields entirely</p>

<h3>My Ideas</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Come up with a things that influence you from different fields, and write about how exactly they have influenced you. E.g. minimalism</li>
  <li>
</ul>

<p>Writing in progress...</p>
