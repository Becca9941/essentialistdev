                                        programming</a> by Johannes Brauer</p>

<h2>Software engineering</h2>

<p>Programmers deal with processing information for the purpose of automating
tasks and activities that were once performed by people. However, every part of
a program down to the smallest details must be programmed by a person.</p>

<blockquote>The computer performs a human task that needs to be automated
  according to a firmly prescribed pattern of behavior laid out in a series of
  ordered individual steps, which must be strictly adhered to. These patterns of
  behaviour are called algorithms.</blockquote>

<p>Designing algorithm takes two main steps. The first is formulating a method
that can solve a problem. The algorithm can be formulated without worrying about
what programming language will be used to implement it. The second step is
converting that method into a language that the computer can understand and
execute.</p>

<blockquote>THe human must determine the method by which a solution can be
  discovered. This can occur either by coming up upon the solution by analysing
  the problem, that is, by thinking about it, or else by finding an existing
  solution to the problem, either by researching it in a relevant text or by
  remembering that one had already solved the problem at an earlier date. At
  bottom, though, a human has to discover the method at least once.</blockquote>

<h2>Basics of object-oriented programming</h2>

<p>The major characteristic of SmallTalk programs are that "Programs consist
exclusively of messages that are sent to objects".</p>

<p>Objects themselves are things that have states and behaviours. States are
characteristics that belong to the object, whilst behaviours are things that
that object can do. Usually the behaviours involve manipulating the
characteristics in some way (my assumption).</p>

<p>Objects can also be more abstract in nature, they can be things like
emotions, events, amounts, contracts etc.</p>

<p>Object-oriented program allows us to create (to some extent) a replica of the
real world with objects that mimic the objects that would carry out the tasks
their person counter parts would if the job was not to be automated. This
virtual replica of the real world is called a model within the object-oriented
paradigm, and the process of creating it is called modelling, or model
construction.</p>

<p>An important distinction between objects in our model and the real world is
that the objects in our model world will contain far less characteristics. The
characteristics and behavior of a real world object is too complex to be
captured in a model, and also uneccessary.</p>

<p>Consequently, an important part of Object-oriented programming is
abstraction.</p>

<blockquote>Dictionary definition: Abstraction is the process of taking away or
  removing characteristics from something in order to reduce it to a set of
  essential characteristics.</blockquote>

<p class="note">Could be an idea to look at the objects around me and reduce it
down to what I think are the essential characteristics and behaviours associated
with them.</p>

<p>Input from colleague: Abstraction doesn't just mean simplifying something,
but also means encapsulating data and coming up with metaphors that make the
story of how the objects interact with each other easier to explain.</p>

<blockquote>In object-oriented programming, a program is viewed as an ordered
  series of messages directed toward a goal, which are sent to appropriate
  objects.</blockquote>

<p>In an object-oriented program, objects exchange messages. When an object
recieves a message, it can react by providing information about its status, or
by changing its status. The important thing here is that it'gives' its status or
it changes its own status. Other objects can not interfere with the inner
workings of other objects (at least they are not supposed to).</p>

<p>This means that the status of an objects (the state of its characteristics)
are not visible from the outside. They can only be seen by sending messages that
ask (and are permitted) to see them, or ask (and are permitted) for them to be
changed. This is an important characteristic in Object-oriented design, known as
'information hiding'.</p>

<p>Another important note, you can send messages to objects, but they have to be
able to understand them. You can't send a message to an object that it doesn't
understand. e.g you can't ask a fraction to add another fraction to itself if it
doesn't know how to add.</p>

<p>In object-oriented programming, messages are methods that objects can
execute. Executing a method is sending a message.</p>

<p>The methods that an object has form the externally visible surface
(interface) of the object. Methods are only executed as a reaction to messages
they have recieved. Messages are methods executed by other objects, also as a
reaction to messages that they have recieved.</p>

<p>When an object sends a message to another object who responds, the sender
recieves an object as a result.</p>
