<p>Notes are based on Pharo by Example, a free book suggested by a Mooc called <a href="https://www.canal-u.tv/producteurs/inria/cours_en_ligne/live_object_programming_in_pharo">Live Object Programming in Pharo</a></p>

<h2>Pharo basics tutorial commands</h2>

<p>The following examples show you how to run commands, print commands and
inspect commands, as well as what they do.</p>

<p class="note">It looks like Smalltalk statements are finished with a
fullstop.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="lang-smalltalk">GTPlayground open.</code> opens a new
    playground window.</li>
  <li><code class="lang-smalltalk">SmalltalkImage current aboutThisSystem</code>
  brings up a window that gives you information about Pharo.</li>
  <li><code class="lang-smalltalk">1 + 2.</code> Returns 3 when you print it to
  the screen (Command-P)</li>
  <li><code class="lang-smalltalk">Date today.</code> Returns 24 July 2019 (or
    whatever the current date is).</li>
  <li><code class="lang-smalltalk">Time now.</code> Returns the current time in
  this format - 12:38:44.64634 pm</li>
  <li><code class="lang-smalltalk">SmalltalkImage current datedVersion.</code>
    Returns 'Pharo6.0 of 13 May 2016' (or the most recent version).</li>
  <li><code class="lang-smalltalk">1/2.</code>Inspecting this using Command-I
    brings up a window containing information about the object. The window
    contains two tabs. The first tab is called "Raw", and contains information
    about the variables contained within the object. In this case there are 3
    variables: self = (1/2), numerator = 1, denominator = 2. In the "Meta" tab
    we can see what types the object belongs to. In this case the types are:
    Fraction, Number, Magnitude, Object, ProtoObject.</li>
  <li><code class="lang-smalltalk">DateAndTime today.</code> When inspecting
    this object, there is an additional tab called "Details" that shows a bunch
  of key value pairs.</li>
  <li><code class="lang-smalltalk">Float Pi.</code> When inspecting this object,
  instead of a details tab there is a "Float" tab which also shows key value
  pairs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Messages</h2>

<p>There are three types of messages in Smalltalk: Unary, Binary and
keyword. Unary messages are executed first, then binary messages and finally
keyword messages: Unary &gt; Binary &gt; Keywords. Messages that contain equal
precedence are executed left to right unless parentheses are used to change the
order of evaluation.</p>

<h4>Unary message examples</h4>

<p>Unary messages are formatted like this: "anObject aMessage"
<ul>
  <li><code class="lang-smalltalk">1 class.</code> Returns SmallInteger</li>
  <li><code class="lang-smalltalk">false not.</code>Returns true</li>
  <li><code class="lang-smalltalk">Time now.</code>Returns timestamp
		(2:29:33.63093 pm)</li>
  <li><code class="lang-smalltalk">Date today.</code>Returns todays date in this
	format: 24 July 2019</li>
  <li><code class="lang-smalltalk">Float pi.</code>Returns 3.141592653589793</li>
  <li><code class="lang-smalltalk">"And of course:"</code>Didn't return anything</li>
</ul>

<h4>Binary message examples</h4>

<p>Binary messages are formatted like this: "anObject + anotherObject"</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="lang-smalltalk">3 * 2.</code>Returns 6</li>
  <li><code class="lang-smalltalk">Date today + 3 weeks.</code>Returned 14
		August 2019</li>
  <li><code class="lang-smalltalk">false | false</code>Returned false</li>
  <li><code class="lang-smalltalk">true & true.</code>Returned true</li>
  <li><code class="lang-smalltalk">true & false.</code>Returned false</li>
  <li><code class="lang-smalltalk">10 @ 100.</code>Returned (10@100)</li>
  <li><code class="lang-smalltalk">10 $lt;= 12.</code>Returned true</li>
	<li><code class="lang-smalltalk">'ab', 'cd'.</code>Returned 'abcd'</li>
	<li><code class="lang-smalltalk">Date today &lt; Date
			yesterday.</code>Returned false</li>
</ul>

<h4>Keyword message examples</h4>

<p>Keyword messages are messages with arguments, they look like this: anObject
akey: anotherObject akey2: anotherObject2</p>

<ul>
	<li><code class="lang-smalltalk">4 between: 0 and: 10.</code>Returned true.
		This means: between 0 and 10 is the message sent to the 4 object.</li>
	<li><code class="lang-smalltalk">1 max: 3.</code>Returns 3</li>
	<li><code class="lang-smalltalk">Color r:1 g:0 b:0.</code>Returned Color red</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cascade operator</h4>

<p>The semi colon is the cascade operator. It is used to send multiple messages
to the same receiver.</p>

<code class="lang-smalltalk">ProfStef next; next.</code>

<p>The above code in the tutorial goes to the next page and then to the next
page by sending two next messages to the same ProfStef object. This part of the
tutorial was confusing to me because a transcript example was used which made it
difficult to figure out what was needed. I forgot that 'next' was the message
and 'ProfStef' was the object so kept trying to write "ProfStef next; ProfStef
next".</p>

<h4>Blocks</h4>

<p>Blocks are anonymous methods that can be stored into variables and executed
on demand. A block is contained within square brackets. Blocks are only executed
when you send it a value message/s</p>

<figure>
	<figcaption>Block with variable</figcaption>
	<pre>
	<code class="lang-smalltalk">
	|b|
	b := [:x | x+2].
	b value: 12.
	</code>
	</pre>
</figure>

<p>This is what is happening:</p>

<ul>
	<li>First we create a variable named 'b' that does not have a value assigned
		to it yet.<code class="lang-smalltalk">|b|</code>.</li>
	<li>We use the <code class="lang-smalltalk">:=</code>to assign a block to our
		b variable. A block is a method that is executed when it is given a
		value.</li>
	<li>We give our block (now contained in our b variable) a value of 12.
		Everything in Smalltalk is an object, so 12 is an integer object.</li>
	<li>Now that the block has a value, it executes. The left hand side of the
		block statement is a placeholder for an object, so it becomes our 12
		object.</li>
	<li>The right hand side of the block statement is a message that we send to our
		object (messages are methods that our object knows how to execute). In this
		case, the message we are sending to our object is '+2'. If our object was a
		string, then it wouldn't be able to accept the message because it doesn't
		know how to add 2 to itself.</p></li>
	<li>When the block is executed, it returns 14 (another integer object).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conditionals</h2>

<p>Conditionals are just messages that are sent to Boolean objects.</p>

<figure>
  <figcaption>Conditional example</figcaption>
  <pre>
  <code class="lang-smalltalk">
  1 &lt; 2
    ifTrue: [100]
    ifFalse: [42].
  </code>
  </pre>
</figure>

<p>This is what is happening:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First we create a binary message (anObject + anotherObject), that returns
   a True or False Boolean object depending on the result of the binary message
   (in this case, is 1 less than 2).</li>
  <li>This boolean object is then passed as a message to the ifTrue object which
    returns 100 if the boolean object it received was True. If the boolean
    object was not true, then it is passed to the ifFalse object which returns
    42 if the object was False.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Loops</h2>

<p>Loops are known as 'high level collection iterators' in the Smalltalk
language. You can have to:do loops and to:by:do loops.</p>

<p>The following example is a to:do loop which returns a list of numbers from 1
to 100. Each number was converted to a string object in the process.</p>

<code class="lang-smalltalk">1 to: 100 do: [:i | Transcript show: i asString;
  cr].</code>

<p>The following example is a to:by:do loop. This loop starts with the number
100 and counts backwards by -2 until it gets to zero. The result is a list of
even numbers from 100 to 0. Each number was converted to a string in the
process.</p>

<code class="lang-smalltalk">100 to: 0 by: -2: [:i | Transcript show: i
  asString; cr].</code>

<p>The message 'do:' is sent to a collection of objects (collections can be an
Array, Set, OrderedCollection). The do: message evaluates the block that follows
for each element in the collection.</p>

<p>Here are a few more loop examples which replace the do: keyword messages with
alternative keyword messages like ":collect", ":select" and ":reject".</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="lang-smalltalk">#(11 38 3 -2 10) collect: [:each | each
      odd].</code>returns the following array: #(true, false true false false).</li>
  <li><code class="lang-smalltalk">#(11 38 3 -2 10) select: [:each | each
      odd].</code>Returns the following array: #(11 3)</li>
  <li><code class="lang-smalltalk">#(11 38 3 -2 10) select: [:each &gt;
      10].</code>Returns the following array: #(11 38).</li>
  <li><code class="lang-smalltalk">#(11 38 3 -2 10) reject: [:each | each &gt;
      10].</code>Returns the following array: #(3 -2 10)</li>
</ul>
