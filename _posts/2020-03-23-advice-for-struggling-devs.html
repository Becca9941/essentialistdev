<h2>Trying Combinations Of Pieces</h2>

<p><strong>Me: I don't know how to solve problems as elegantly as you can, it's hard to just keep shooting in the dark when I don't know if I'm heading in the right direction.</strong></p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> If you think about kids learning language, they’ll experiment with the building blocks and they’ll come up with amusing constructs that are understandable but not ideal. We gently correct them, even though we understand them, because those amusing constructs have rough edges that will make things harder in the real world.</p>

<p>When I’m observing you performing something that I am skilled in, there are things that I can see that you can’t. I might know that two pieces don’t fit together well because I’ve tried those pieces in the past, but I couldn’t tell you in advance not to use those two pieces because I didn’t know until you started putting them together that that was a pattern you were going to try.</p>

<p>I’ve tried many, many thousands of combinations of pieces, and when I say “those bits don’t fit well”, I don’t mean “those bits don’t fit at all”, because we can make things fit together by adding supporting monstrosities around them (like the high rise slums). What I’m trying to get at is “there’s a Japanese joinery solution for the thing that you’re trying to force together with glue, rope, and nails; and the joinery version will be easier to change later because it’s not all gummed up with glue, rope, and nails”</p>

<p>And while I’d love to give you a curriculum, a specific map for how to achieve everything you want to, I’m afraid that I literally have no idea how to do that. Every single person that I have coached or mentored over the years, I have done it by watching them try to put pieces together and telling them whether I think it will work or not.</p>

<p>Sometimes, someone might put together two pieces in a way I’ve never seen before, and I’ll say “I have no idea if those pieces will fit, let’s explore”.</p>

<p>But typically the learning process is "A, will these two pieces fit together?” “No, they don’t quite match”</p>

<p>“OK, what about these two?” “Those are better, but you probably want to try these two”</p>

<p>Until eventually, the other person is asking whether two pieces will fit and they’re usually getting “Yes” answers.</p>

<p>But there’s no test, no right answers, it’s randomly trying bits with each other until we learn which bits fit well together and which bits don’t.</p>

<h2>You Get Better At Recognising Pieces And Shapes</h2>

<p><strong>Me: I can't even write simple programs.</strong></p>

<p>What I’m observing with your frustrations is that when you say “I can’t even write simple programs”, it’s because you don’t know:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Which pieces are available to you, and</li>
  <li>How the pieces fit together.</li>
</ol>

<p>My advice to you is to look around and try to find as many pieces as you can… As you find more pieces, you’ll begin to understand what pieces look like and it’ll be easier to find new ones. Play with the pieces that you already have, and I’ll try and steer you away from combinations that will require you to use too much supporting infrastructure to hold them together.</p>

<p>Reading design patterns shows you, not only some examples of small pieces, but also some examples of small pieces assembled into larger shapes, and gives some reasons about why we might want those shapes.</p>

<p>As you get better at recognising pieces and shapes, you also get better at recognising glue, rope, and nails. So code that used to look ok to you, you begin to see that it’s actually not that great and is not well held together. So then, you can identify bad code, not because you know what the good code will look like, but because you can see that there’s too much glue involved.</p>

<p>I think that’s what Ward Cunningham was getting at when he talked about clean code and elegant code. Clean code is using the absolute minimum of glue… everything that’s there needs to be there. Elegant code is the Japanese joinery… there is no need for glue, it was designed to create this shape.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p><strong>Me: I'm completely overwhelmed with programming right now. I'm really trying to learn Test-driven development, object-oriented programming and design patterns plus a bunch of other things, but am really struggling...[]</strong></p>

<p><strong>K:</strong> Sounds like you are taking a deeply thoughtful approach to learning programming. A mistake I frequently make (in programming and [hobby], for example) is thinking too much and doing too little. All that theory jumbles up my brain so I can't act without second guessing myself eight different ways.</p>

<p>What I have learned is that I can't learn it all. I can't even learn most of it right away. If I learn a little, do a little, learn a little, and do a little then I maximize my learning and reduce anxiety.</p>

<p>Regarding your pair seeing stuff you don't see: that's what's supposed to happen.</p>

<p>Nobody understands everything and yet they get stuff done. The same is true of you. Cut yourself some slack. And code.</p>

<p>Accept that your contribution will be small at first. I started out just pointing out to my first mentor where his parentheses didn't balance. I was already useful and I was around enough to start to see the bigger patterns at work.</p>

<p>Another technique is to take something you worked on together and try to reproduce a small version on your own. Whether you succeed or fail doesn't matter, but where you get stuck is valuable feedback about what to learn next.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>
