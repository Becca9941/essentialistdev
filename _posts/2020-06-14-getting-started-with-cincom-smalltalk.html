<p>I downloaded <a href="http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/main/products/visualworks/" target="_blank">Cincom Visualworks 9.0</a> today, which is a programming environment for writing Smalltalk applications (using the Smalltalk-80 language).</p>

<p>When it downloaded, I installed it by double-clicking on the installMacOSX.app file and following the wizard instructions.</p>

<p>To open visualWorks, I searched for it in the finder. There were a couple of options that came up, I clicked on the one for Mac and that seemed to work okay.</p>

<p>To learn how to use the developer environment tools, I'll be going through each of the <a href="http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/main/community/resources/smalltalk-product-tutorials/?utm_campaign=CST_US_FY15_VW%20Download%2FNurture&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=15335373&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8UsRBL-tGBfbdGAzmZXpdHNUg6BHbOH4O0DXwBag2CUro-I3hbB0ss9CVGosomOc-4xsTLXaX2jNBvFNPiMHAquNlSYA&utm_content=15335373&utm_source=hs_automation" target="_blank">Cincom Smalltalk Product Tutorials</a> and keeping notes along the way.</p>

<h2>System Browser Overview: Getting Started With Smalltalk</h2>

<p>You can open the system browser by clicking on the icon in the toolbar that looks like a magnifying glass to the right of three nodes on a vertical branch.</p>

<p>The System Browser contains four panels along the top, and a window containing content spanning below the panels.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Panel 1: Packages and bundles</li>
  <li>Panel 2: Classes</li>
  <li>Panel 3: Method Categories</li>
  <li>Panel 4: Methods</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two primary ways we'll use the browser:</p>

<ol>
  <li>To explore classes and methods to reuse.</li>
  <li>To write your own classes and methods for your application.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is what the System Browser looks like:</p>

<p>I'm really impressed by the quality of the resources and the clean feel of the cincom application at the moment. I first tried Smalltalk with Pharo, and I prefer the Cincom version. Pharo is pretty new though so it's no where near as developed or documented as the Cincom version. I don't know it well enough to compare it fairly beyond these initial impressions.</p>
