<p>Another JavaScript challenge on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">Free Code Camp</a>!</p>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

<p>We have an array of objects representing different people in our contacts lists.</p>

<p>A lookUpProfile function that takes name and a property (prop) as arguments has been pre-written for you.</p>

<p>The function should check if name is an actual contact's firstName and the given property (prop) is a property of that contact.</p>

<p>If both are true, then return the "value" of that property.</p>

<p>If name does not correspond to any contacts then return "No such contact".</p>

<p>If prop does not correspond to any valid properties of a contact found to match name then return "No such property".</p>

<h2>Final Solution</h2>

<pre>
<code>
function lookUpProfile(name, prop){
  const contact = contacts.find((aContact) =&gt; aContact.firstName == name);
  if(!contact) { return "No such contact"; }
  if(!contact.hasOwnProperty(prop)) { return "No such property"; }

  return contact[prop];

}
</code>
<pre>

<h2>Refactoring Process</h2>

<p>First solution before refactoring:</p>

<pre>
<code>
function lookUpProfile(name, prop){
  for(var i = 0; i &lt; contacts.length; i++) {
    var contact = contacts[i];
    if(contact.firstName == name) {
        if(contact.hasOwnProperty(prop)) {
          return contact[prop];
        } else {
            return "No such property";
        }
    }
  }
  return "No such contact";
// Only change code above this line
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>I'm working through the Free Code Camp's JavaScript curriculum as a refresher. This problem came right after the loop section which is why I used a loop here instead of map or filter. The official solution also uses a loop, because this is before we are expected to know of anything more advanced.</p>

<p>I used guard clauses to get rid of the if/else statements. Then I paired with a much more experienced dev who helped me refactor further by introducing me to the array.find arrow function. Cool!</p>
