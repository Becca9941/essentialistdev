<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>A wellbeing wheel is a great tool for helping you visualise how you are doing in each area of your life right now. Once you have filled yours in, you will be able to see which areas are doing well, and which areas need a bit more work to improve. For the areas you have chosen to work on, you can easily brainstorm actions you can take to help you acheive your goal. Over time, you can compare your previous wellbeing wheels to see how your wellbeing evolves over time.</p>

<p>At the end of this article, you will find a <a href="#action">Wellbeing Wheel Action Plan</a> that you can print out as often as you need. Each area of your life is a segment in a wheel that each have a scale between 1 and 10, where 1 is the worst-case scenario and 10 is the best. There is also a form that helps you choose which area to focus on and come up with actions to improve things for you.</p>

<h2 id="what">What Is Your Definition Of Wellbeing?</h2>

<p>The Better Health Channel's definition of Wellbeing is "Wellbeing is not just the absence of disease or illness. It is a complex combination of a person's physical, mental, emotional and social health factors. Wellbeing is strongly linked to happiness and life satisfaction. In short, wellbeing could be described as how you feel about yourself and your life."</p>

<p>The great thing about this definition is that it's not a one-size fits all description. People with chronic illnesses or disabilities can still live full, positive lives despite significant physical or mental restrictions. Or you may find some extremely 'fit' people who struggle with some kind of addiction or mental health disorder, who might not describe themselves as being in a state of excellent wellbeing.</p>

<p>Excellent wellbeing is a very individual experience. There are many factors that come into play, and they will change over time to match your current circumstances. So it's important to come up with your own definition of excellent wellbeing so that we can come up with a plan to meet your specific needs.</p>

<p>Take a moment to do that now. Go and grab a notebook, find a quiet place and think about what excellent wellbeing means to you and write it down. Here are three prompts to get you started: 1) A time when you felt your best in the past, 2) Aspects that you feel are lacking right now or could be improved and 3) Examples of other people you know or have heard of who you think are living their best lives. Bonus points if you get someone else to do the same so you can compare your notes afterwards.</p>

<p>You can use your definition of wellbeing to help you rate your wellbeing across several areas of your life. It's also interesting to keep hold of your definition and write a new one now and again, so you can see how your definition has evolved over time as you begin to master some of areas that may currently be holding you back.</p>

<h2 id="what2">What Is A Wellbeing Wheel?</h2>

<p>A wellbeing wheel is a simple but powerful tool that helps you visualise how you are doing in each of the different areas of your life. Career and Life Coaches often refer to it as the <a href="https://wheeloflife.noomii.com/" target="_blank">Wheel Of Life</a>, because each area of your life is mapped onto a circle, much like the spoke of a wheel. I chose to call this version a wellbeing wheel, because we will be using it to brainstorm actions hat will help increase our feelings of general wellbeing.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why Should You Use A Wellbeing Wheel?</h2>

<p>Rating scales are used a lot by health-care professionals to get a better idea of how you are currently doing mentally and physically. The completed form allows them to work with you to develop a treatment plan that is tailored to your current needs. Multiple scales can be compared with each other to see whether the treatment plan has moved you forward or need to be adjusted.</p>

<p>You can do the same thing at home, though if your total score for the following scale turns out to be less than 80 (below average), please seek support from a health-care professional. It's a good idea to do that anyway.</p>

<p>The first thing we are going to do is fill out our own wellbeing rating scale. Then, we will use it to come up with an action plan to help us improve our wellbeing.</p>

<h2 id="how">How To Use A Wellbeing Wheel To Change Your Life?</h2>

<p>There are two ways you can use your wellbeing wheel. The first way is to fill in the spokes of the wheel so that you can see how you feel about different areas of your life. Each spoke has ten notches on it from 1-10, where one is the worst it can be for you <em>right now</em>, and ten is the best it can be for you right now. Once the wheel is complete, you will be able to see immediately which areas of your life are doing really well, and which areas need a bit more work.</p>

<p>The second way to use your wellbeing wheel is to actively try and improve the areas you want to focus on. It can be helpful to pick one main area to start with, which might be the shortest spoke on your wheel, or just a wheel that you'd like to keep improving while it is going strong. The area you choose is up to you, though it's a good idea to try and get all of your areas as balanced as possible.</p>

<p>Once you have chosen an area you want to improve, it can be helpful to write down one tiny action that you can act on immediately to improve it in some way. There's usually something you can do even if it's just writing down a reminder to follow through with an action in the morning or at a later date. I usually fill in a wellbeing wheel once a month, so after doing a small immediate action, I also write down three further actions I can do throughout the rest of the month, making sure to schedule them in.</p>

<p>After filling out your wellbeing wheel action plan, your task is to reflect on any patterns you see. Are some areas better than others? Do you know why that may be? How do you feel now that you can see how you are doing in different areas of your life?</p>

<p>If you completed the challenge, high five for taking action! Bonus points if you leave a comment telling us which action you are going to take to improve one of the areas you have chosen to focus on.</p>
