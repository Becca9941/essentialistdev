title: Setting up book collection page using Jekyll, including Twitter share links!
---

<p>My site currently runs on Github Pages. It's a static site, but I'm seeing how far I can push it, and make it a truly awesome site that no one will realise is actually static.</p>

<p>My current aim, is to create a page which lists a bunch of books that I have read and have provided an overview, raw notes and tips for. This post assumes that you already know how to use Jekyll.</p>

<h2>Collections</h2>

<p>In Jekyll, you can create individual <em>posts</em> and <em>pages</em>. Collections are for things that don't fall into those categories, like books and recipies etc.</p>

<p>Gah, I have a bit of a headache going on so will just capture the code for now and write a proper tutorial once I've finished the book page.</p>

<h2>_config.yml</h2>

<pre>
<code>
collections:
  books:
    output: true
    permalink: /books/:path
</code>
</pre>

<h2>_books/the-pragmatic-programmer.html</h2>
