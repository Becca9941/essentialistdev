title: Reflecting on test-driven attempt at solving an old interview problem. 
---

<p>In earlier blog posts, I documented my process for building a test-driven solution to an old interview problem. The test files and matching production code files are shown below.</p>

<p>Before attempting to solve this problem, I had been really struggling to learn TDD for a while. I wasn't sure if I'd get very far trying to test-drive the following code but was actually pleasantly surprised. Something clicked with TDD a bit more. I could see how it can help drive a design.</p>

<p>The solution below is incomplete. I was able to test-drive all of the individual pieces that make up the solution. However, I am missing some object-oriented design skills which meant that I wasn't sure how to make the pieces all work together as collaborating objects without calling them in a procedural way.</p>

<p>To get better, it could help to learn more about design patterns to get more exposure to object-oriented style solutions. So close to being able to do this all properly though, just got to keep at it!</p>
