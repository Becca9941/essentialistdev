   Reading</a> by Mortimer. J. Adler and Charles Van Doren.</p>

<h2>Reading for the sake of increased understanding</h2>

<p>The written world has the power to shape our understanding of who we are and
the environment that surrounds us. Reading allows us to encounter ideas and
perspectives that can shift the trajectory of our lives.</p>

<p>All of the information that we consume leaves some form of residue, an
imprint on our minds and emotions. If we are exposed to these ideas often
enough, they become a part of our own personal narratives.</p>

<p>When encountering an idea for the first time, the narrator who exposes it to
you begins to shape the way that you think about that idea, even if they only
have a little more experience on the topic than you.</p>

<p>If you are disproportionately exposed to the ideas held by one individual or
a like-minded collective, then you become constrained by a narrative that
prevents you from encountering alternative perspectives that may offer benifits
exceeding your own perspective.</p>

<p>Seeking out information, ideas and inspiration from multiple sources allow us
to begin expanding the constraints of our own personal narratives. However, it
isn't enough to just expose ourselves to these thoughts and ideas, because we
only ever see the peak of them, not the history that is woven into the mountain
supporting them.</p>

<p>Have you ever struggled to understand a concept you were studying? Chances
are, you sought out alternative explanations in the hope of finding the piece of
the puzzle that would make everything make sense. When you found the missing
piece, the click moment in your brain was likely audible to the people around
you.</p>

<p>The best sources of information contain insights that are just on the
threshold of your understanding. Where you have to stretch just a little bit to
grasp them. This act of 'stretching' takes effort. Reading for the sake of
increased understanding requires active participation on your part.</p>

<h2>The levels of Reading - a roadmap</h2>

<p>All of the levels of reading are cumulative, they all incorporate the
previous levels of reading within themselves.</p>

<h3>1. Elementary Reading</h3>

<img src="/assets/img/elementary.jpg" alt="sillouette of sherlock homes with the
speech bubble: elementary my dear Watson">

<p>There are four stages to elementary reading: Reading readiness, simple
materials, context clues and assimilation.</p>

<h4>Reading readiness</h4>

<p>Reading readiness includes being able to physically see a book, to be able to
speak clearly and to be able to remember what it is you have read. Being able to
work with others is also important in the first stages of learning to read,
because you'll be interacting with mentors and peers to help aid your
understanding of what it is you are (or are not yet) able to read.</p>

<p>If you try to make a child read before they are ready to, then chances are
they will get incredible frustrated and disengage. It is then likely that the
child will carry this dislike of reading into their adulthood.</p>

<h4>Simple materials</h4>

<p>Elementary readers are able to read simple materials. When you first start to
read at school, books generally have only a few key words that are repeated
so that it becomes easy to recognise them. In the first year of reading,
children typically learn 300-400 words a year.</p>

<p class="note">This could be a good benchmark for learning a new language. As
an adult, I'd be curious to run a mini experiment to see how long it would take
to learn 400 words in Russian. Though it might be good to learn these words by
reading 'picture' books in the way that children are taught. Or both.</p>

<p>By the end of this stage, children are able to read simple books by
themselves and are generally enthusiastic about it. The really interesting thing
about this stage is that children start of looking at a page filled with alien
symbols, then very quickly (even in just a couple of weeks) are able to see
meaning in them.</p>

<h4>Context clues</h4>

<p>In the third stage of elementary reading, children are able to start
picking up vocabulary fairly quickly, as well as being able to 'unlock' the
meaning of unfamiliar words through context clue, which is where the sentence as
a whole can reveal the meaning of an unfamiliar word contained in that
sentence.</p>

<p>At this stage of elementary reading, children are able to start reading books
in different areas that interest them, rather than just reading simple books
that have been chosen for them.</p>

<h4>Assimilation</h4>

<p>In the fourth stage of elementary reading, children (or adults learning a
foreign language) are able to start carrying concepts they have read in one book
over to other books that they are reading. They are able to start seeing the
differences in views held by different authors.</p>

<p>Interestingly, this fourth stage of elementary reading is usually reached by
early teens. As an adult, it may only take a couple of weeks or months to get to
this stage when learning a new language, which can also be something like
programming or mathematics.</p>

<h3>2. Inspectional Reading</h3>

<img src="/assets/img/inspectional.jpg" alt="sillouette of inspector gadget with
a magnifying glass arm popping out of his hat"

<p>As there are different stages within the Elementary reading stage, so are
there different stages withing inspectional reading. You know you can read on an
inspectional level when you are able to read a book without having to stop and
look up the meaning of words or without struggling to make sense of what is
being said based on missing knowledge of syntax and grammar.</p>

<h4>Systematic Skimming or Pre-reading</h4>

<p>The first stage in Inspectional reading is sytematic skimming (or
pre-reading). This is where you discover whether a book is worth reading or not.
Here are the rules outlined in How to Read a book for this stage of inspectional
reading:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Look at the title page and, if the book has one, at it's preface. Be sure
    to take note of the subtitles or other indications of the scope or aim of
    the book. After you have done this, you should be able to say what category
    this book belongs to.</li>
  <li>Study the table of contents to get a general sense of what will be
    discussed within the book. According to the authors of "How to read a book",
    not many people actually do this, and so they have to work out what the book
    is about while they are reading it.</li>
  <li>Chech the INDEX of the book if it has one, and make a quick estimate of
    the range of topics covered and the kind of books the authors refer to. If
    you see any terms that you think are crucial, look up some of the passages
    cited. These passages will often contain the main arguments that the entire
  book is hinged on.</li>
  <li>Read the publishers blurb, these are often written by the authors
    themselves with the aim of summarising the main points in their book as
    accurately as they can. Their blurb is likely to have been edited by a
    public relations department to seem more exciting, but the main points will
    still be there.</li>
  <li>Now that you have a sense for what the main arguments are, look at the
    chapters that seem to be essential to the main point of the book and quickly
    read their opening and closing pages.</li>
  <li>Quickly turn the pages of the book and read sentences here and there,
    listening for the main points. Do not fail to read the last two or three
    pages of the book, as this is where the author will sum up what they think
    is important about their work.</li>
  <li class="note">Oh I reaaallly don't like the idea of reading the last few
  pages of a book, but this is based on reading for entertainment and the last
  few pages would ruin the surprise. For example, in the book <a
                                                                href="https://www.amazon.com/Genesis-Bernard-Beckett/dp/0547225490"
                                                                target="_blank">Genesis</a>
  by Bernard Beckett, the last page contains a twist that changes the meaning of
  the entire book. So a caveat for this rule would be to do this for books that
  you are reading to learn from, not read for entertainment only.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Superficial Reading</h4>

<p>The second stage of inspectional reading is called superficial reading. This
is where you read a book through for the first time without pausing to look up
the things you don't understand. This is to stop you getting stuck early on and
giving up on the book. At some point you will get back to a part that you can
understand again. That way if you only read the book through once, you will
understand more than you would have if you stopped reading at the first point
you really struggled to understand.</p>

<p class="note">This actually happened to me when I was reading <a
   href="https://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Kent-Beck/dp/0321146530"
   target="_blank">Test Driven Development</a> by Kent Beck. I spent a week or
 so trying to understand the code examples in the first chapter so that I could
 understand the surrounding concepts better. After the first week I put it aside
 to read again when I'm a 'better' developer. So I'll go back and read it
 through without stopping next time, which will be pretty soon.</p>

<p>A good technique for reading a book through without stopping is to quickly
run your finger under each line you are reading, so that your eye is reading at
the same speed that your finger is moving. Most of the time, when we see
something in a book that we don't understand, our eye fixes on that point
unconciously. Using your finger like this prevents this fixation from happening
and allows you to read past the parts you don't understand easily.</p>

<h2>Active Reading</h2>

<p>This section on active reading is an asside to the main levels of reading,
but is important because if you only read a book passively, then you are not
able to engage in such a way that is necessary for you to really learn from a
book, especially if you are reading for the sake of increased understanding.</p>

<p>At the end of the book, if you have read it actively then you should be able
to articulate an answer to the following four questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What is the book about as a whole? (what is the main message that the
    author is trying to get across to you?)</li>
  <li>What are the main ideas, assertions and arguments that make up the authors
    main message.</li>
  <li>Is the book true, in whole or in part? You have to make your own mind up
    on this. It's not enough to say that you agree or disagree unless you can
    articulate specific reasons for your opinions. Otherwise, those opinions are
    purely driven by emotion and not fact, and you are doing a disservice to the
    author who has put effort into providing evidence and arguments for his
    position.</li>
  <li>Why does the author think that it's important to know those things? (and
    is it important for you to know those things in your opinion?)</li>
</ol>

<p>All of the levels of reading mentioned in this article provides tools and
techniques that if implemented, will help you to be able to answer these
questions.</p>

<p>A good tip for helping you 'own' a book, is to write you reactions to what is
being said in the book in the book itself. I use a highlighter to capture the
essence of what I think is being said. I also use a pen to capture ideas of how
to use the advice in the book in my own life, as well as feelings and reactions.
The following is a quote from the book which advocates this approach.</p>

<blockquote>Full ownership of a book only comes when you have made it a part of
  yourself, and the best way to make yourself a part of it - which is by writing
  in it.</blockquote>

<p>Another standalone point in the book that stood out to me is that sometimes
authors in a book say that some actions are simple, but that you believe are
secretly impossible. This is something I regularly experience with programming,
where expert developers that I am exposed to say that the things they are doing
are easy once you have learned the seperate parts that go into the things they
are doing as a whole.</p>

<h2>3. Analytical Reading</h2>

<img src="/assets/img/analytical.jpg" alt="sillouette of a skeleton with
definitions branching off him">

<p>The third level of reading is Analytical reading, which is made up of four
stages: X-raying a book, capturing the terms, capturing the key messages
(propositions and arguments), criticizing the book fairly and agreeing or
disagreeing with an author.</p>

<h3>X-raying a book</h3>

<p>At the end of the first stage of analytical reading, you should be able to
articulate what kind of book you are reading, what it is about, what parts make
up the book and what problems the author was trying to solve.</p>

<ol>
  <li>You must know what kind of book you are reading (scientific, practical,
    philosophical, technical, poetry, fiction, non-fiction etc)</li>
  <li>You must be able to summarize in a couple of sentences what the book is
    about (Elementary and Inspectional reading). Saying that you know what the
    book is about without actually being able to articulate it is a lie (this
    guideline makes me feel called out).</li>
  <li>You must be able to articulate the major parts of the book and explain how
    they are organised as a whole, and in relation to each other.</li>
  <li class="note">The thought I had in relation to the previous point was in
    relation to a programming approach called Test-Driven Development. As
    someone who is still a 'newbie' at this approach, I can easily say that it
    is about writing a failing test before you write any code, pass the test as
    simple as you can by writing the code, then refactoring the code to make it
    'better'. I can say this without knowing a great deal about the underlying
    parts that make up this approach. So that tells me that there are deeper
    nuances that I'm not picking up on yet. Exciting</li>
  <li>Template for discussing parts of the book as put forth by the authors:
    "The author accomplished this plan in five major parts, of which the first
    part is about so and so, the second part is about....The first of these
    parts is divided into three sections, of which the first considers..."</li>
  <li>Find out what the authors problems were, what problems were they trying to
    solve?</li>
</ol>

<h3>Capturing the terms</h3>

<p>By the end of this stage of analytical reading, you will have compiled a list
of terms (words) that are important in the book, as well as what those words
mean to the author. You'll also have identified whether those words have been
used with different meanings within the book as well as how those meanings
relate to each other.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Find the important words in your book and figure out how the author is
    using them. These words are known as terms. As a reader, the most important
  terms (words) for you are the ones that you struggle to understand the meaning
  of.</li>
  <li>Determine whether the word has more than one meaning in the book you are
    reading. If it does, write down the different use cases as well as how they
    relate to each other.</li>
  <li>Make a list of the important terms and the meanings that are associated
    with them.</li>
  <li class="note">Another technique for finding terms is looking for words that you do not
    ordinarily use. These words could be specialist terminology that are
    specific to the field being discussed in the book.</li>
  <li class="note">A term is especially important if the author has told you that they have
    created it, or if they say that they are using a word differently to how
    other people would use it.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Capturing the key messages (propositions and arguments)</h3>

<p>By the end of this stage you will have identified the things that the author
agreed or disagreed with and why. You'll have been able to articulate the
authors main arguments and reasons for supporting those arguments, as well as
which problems the author provided a solution to through his arguments. You will
also be able to talk about the problems that the author left unsolved, as well
as whether or not they knew they had left these problems unsolved.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Mark the important sentences in a book and identify the propositions they
    contain. "A proposition is an authors expression of judgement on something".
    Propositions that are not supported by reasons are just opinions.</li>
  <li class="note">Not all sentences can be called propositions. A proposition
    is an answer to a question. A good technique here is asking yourself whether
  you can point to an experience in your own life that demonstrates this
  preposition in action.</li>
  <li>Write down the arguments that a book contains by finding them in the
    connections between sentences. The arguments themselves are the major
    agreements or denials the author is making that also include reasons in
    support of these claims. You might have multiple propositions that make up a
    major argument.</li>
  <li>Find out what the authors solutions are. After completing all of the
    previous levels and stages up until this point, you should have identified
    the problems that the author was trying to solve. You should also now be in
    a position to write down which of these problems the author managed to
    solve, either in whole or in part.</li>
  <li>Finally, write down which problems the author knew they didn't solve, as
    well as any problems you believe the author is unaware that they didn't
    solve.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Fair criticism</h3>

<p>This stage is about being aware of your biases when you make critical
judgements in agreement or disagreement with the author. You must be able to
support your own arguments with more than just 'this feels right/wrong'.</p>

<ol>
  <li>You must be able to say that you fully understand the argument and the
  reasons behind an argument the author is making before you can say that you
  agree or disagree.</li>
  <li>You must be able to give your own reasons based on fact for any of the
  agreements and disagreements that you do make. It is not enough to say you
  agree or disagree based on pure emotion and opinion only.</p>
</ol>

<h3>Agreeing or disagreeing with the author</h3>

<ul>

  <li>In order to be able to say that the author is <em>uninformed</em>, you must be able to
yourself state the knowledge the author lacks as well as how that knowledge if
known would make a difference to their conclusions.</li>

  <li>In order to say that an author is <em>misinformed</em>, you must be able to
argue that there is an alternative truth that is more credible.</li>

  <li>In order to say that an author is <em>illogical</em>, then you must be able
to articulate the exact area of the authors argument that contains a defect and
why.</li>

  <li>If you haven't been able to show that the author is uninformed, misinformed or
illogical, then it is impossible for you to disagree. If you continue to
disagree, the only basis is that you don't <em>like</em> the conclusion that was
drawn.</li>

</ul>

<p>If you believe that the author has made an incomplete analysis, but that you
still can't show that the author was uninformed, misinformed or illogical, then
you have no choice but to agree until you have yourself conducted a more
complete analysis that enables you to disagree based on the arguments listed
above.</p>

<h3>A few additional tips for reading analytically</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Don't ask for help trying to understand a book until you have thouroughly
    inspected and analysed it yourself. Anyone else's opinion will bias your own
    responses. But do seek help from commentaries or other people once you have
    read it through properly yourself, because they might offer perspectives
    that you may not have encountered by yourself.</li>
  <li>When reading practical books, it's important to remember that they can not
    actually solve the problems they are talking about. They are merely telling
    you how to solve those problems in a specific way for yourself.</li>

  <blockquote>
    A practical problem can only be solved by action itself.
  </blockquote>

  <li>When reading practical books, there are two main questions you should ask
    yourself. First is: What is the author's objectives? Second is: What means
    are they proposing for achieving those objectives?</li>

</ul>

<h2>4. Syntopical reading</h2>

<img src="/assets/img/syntopical.jpg" alt="a bunch of circles all connected to
each other">

<ol>
  <li>After having completed the first three levels of reading for one book or
    paper on the subject you are interested in, compile a tentative reading list
    for similar works that could be worth reading</li>
  <li>Complete an inspectional reading for all of those sources, and of those
    you have read, keep the ones that you think will be important for your
    project.</li>
  <li>Conduct an analytical reading on only the chapters that are relevant for
    your project.</li>
  <li>Construct a terminology that is general to all of the sources you are
    reading. If there terms have different meanings accross those works, include
    those as well.</li>
  <li>Establish a set of questions (prepostions) that the most of the authors
    have given answers to, whether or not they treat the questions explicitly or
    not.</li>
  <li>Define a set of issues (arguments) that have been covered by the authors,
    ranging from most important to least important. Divide the authors arguments
    by whether they are for or against the issue. You are likely to have to
    interpret where they fall on the spectrum yourself.</li>
  <li>Examine the evidence in support of each of the authors arguments in
    comparison to each other and come to a conclusion as to which arguments
    appear stronger or weaker, and why.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Actions to take after reading this book</h2>

<p>My favourite books are those that are usuable. Which means that when
implemented, they add real value to my life. Before reading this book, I already
scribbled all over my books and asked a ton of questions that I sought answers
to. However, these are things I thought to do by myself. So a book that gives an
actual roadmap for reading a book for the purpose of increased understanding
really caught my attention.</p>

<p>The actions I want to take after reading this are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Develop a <a href="/learning-russian.html">mini curriculum for learning
      Russian</a> based on the Elementary
    reading level. e.g. learn 400 words, read simple books until I can
    understand them without having to look up every other word.</li>
  <li>Read through a couple of the technical programming books right through
    without pausing to try and understand things that I struggle with the first
    time through. I'll eventually get to parts I do understand, so if I never
    read them again (unlikely) then at least I'll have gotten more out of it
    than I would have.</li>
  <li>Go through all of the reading levels on my new stats book, and a practical
    programming book to see if this approach really does help me to increase my
    understanding.</li>
</ul>
