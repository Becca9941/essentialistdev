<p>I want to build an interval timer app, and thought a Kotlin Android app would be a good way to go. I'm following a Google Codelabs tutorial called: <a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/build-your-first-android-app-kotlin/#0" target="_blank">Build Your First Android App in Kotlin</a>.</p>

<p>I already have <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio" target="_blank">Android Studio</a> installed via homebrew: <code>brew cask install "android-studio"</code></p>

<p>I started a new Android Studio Project and selected the "Basic Activity" Phone and tablet option. I called my project "Appy", which is my default playground app name.</p>
